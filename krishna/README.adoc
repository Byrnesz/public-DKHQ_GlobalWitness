== Satellite Acquisition Package

This is a python package that provides a simple (hopefully?) API to google-earth-engine to facilitate the download of satellite imagery. The user will input the imagery collection of interest, the beginning and end dates, and a file of mine locations. The package will query the appropriate imagery from earth engine and download the GeoTiff images to the indicated folder.

Note that credentials to access Earth Engine must be obtained separately.
